            <p>I'm an aspiring software developer who is currently participating in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote Course, I gotta say it's pretty swell. Developing stuff is like a game to me. I build stuff piece by piece and I get a great sense of accomplishment when I get something to finally work and a big O'l ego boost when I get something to work on the first try. So overall I can see myself having a very rewarding career that I am excited to get started. Though I still have a ton to learn about the different languages I have learned so far...</p>
